                        worth a great deal if it teaches Young People how to make a Living but doesn’s 
                        teach them how to make a Life… System is increasingly embracing a 
                        Black-and-White way of thinking, in which Learning and Play are DIAMETRICALLY 
                        OPPOSED. So, the true purpose of Education is to make Minds, not Careers… President vanitha 
                        degree college threw in the Powerful Weapons which are used to change the world.</p>
